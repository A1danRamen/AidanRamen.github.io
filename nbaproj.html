          <h2>NBA Season Simulator Game</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          This project was developed using Java and JavaFX. It's a game where the user can create NBA teams and players and simulate a season. Once the season is over, relative statistics will be updated for each team and player. As individual players gain more points, they progress through levels: Edge, Core, Common and All-Star. This project helped gain familiarity with UI and the
          Model-View-Controller architecture and it's benefits.

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            The resolution is poor because I had to crop the video as the game is primarily designed to be played using several windows. This is done to reinforce modular architecture with each separate window mapped to an individual view in MVC.
